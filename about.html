					<h1>What is it?</h1>
					<p>
						Lists4Home is a simple concept. People make lists on napkins, scraps of paper, in their heads, it's the way we organise the world. Lists4Home
						tries to create intelligent ways for us to make these lists and then make them available everywhere.
						<br>
						We provide intelligent lists that allow
						items to be checked off, removed, categorised and added with ease.
					</p>
					<h1>How does it work?</h1>
					<p>
						We like to think this system is easy to use. Create an account on the system, by providing some basic details and you immediately have
						access to the shopping list.
						<br>
						<h2>Create An Account</h2>
						If you have never logged in before you will be taken to the login page. Click on the registration link, fill in the details and submit.
						<br>
						We suggest creating an account for a
						household as apposed to an individual. That way it is easy for one member to do the shopping even if someone else added items to the list.
						<br>
						<h2>Access your Lists</h2>
						These lists have been created such that they are accessible on any device. Once you have logged onto your account on a given device you should
						never have to log on again. It will remember you.
