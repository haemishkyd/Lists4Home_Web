	<h1>What is it?</h1>
	<p>Lists4Home is a simple concept. People make lists on napkins, scraps of paper, in their heads, it's the way we organise the world. Lists4Home
		tries to create intelligent ways for us to make these lists and then make them available everywhere. <br> We provide intelligent lists that allow
		items to be checked off, removed, categorised and added with ease. <br> Currently we offer a specific Shopping List and Wine List. Keep watching
		as we add more.</p>
	<h1>How does it work?</h1>
	<p>We like to think this system is easy to use. Create an account on the system, by providing some basic details and you immediately have 
		access to all of our lists.<br>
		<h2>Create An Account</h2>
		Click on "Create Account" and enter your details. That's it. You have an account.<br> We suggest creating an account for a 
		household as apposed to an individual. That way it is easy for one member to do the shopping even if someone else added items to the list.<br>
		<h2>Access your Lists</h2>
		These lists have been created such that they are accessible on any device. Once you have logged onto your account on a given device you should
		never have to log on again. It will remember you. <br>
		Access the lists on a computer by coming to this site: <a href="http://www.lists4home.com">PC Link</a><br>
		Access the lists on a cell phone or tablet by adding the following links to your device bookmarks:<br>
		<a href="http://shop.lists4home.com">shop.lists4home.com</a><br>
		<a href="http://wine.lists4home.com">wine.lists4home.com</a><br>
		</p>
	<h1>What are the future plans?</h1>
	<p>We have big plans going forward. Please let us know about any lists you might find useful by clicking on the "Contact" link.
		<br>We also have plans to deploy cell phone apps for the lists. The Android app is currently in development, iPhone to follow soon.<br>
		We hope you enjoy using this as much as we have enjoyed writing it.</p>
